The game does not have all the same cards as my other ones but there is a lot of great new ARC-V cards. There is many Pendulum monsters in this game. Unfortunately you canâ€™t use Pendulum Summons in Power of Chaos games and most of the cards donâ€™t have their effects. Anyway, Iâ€™m sure you will love itâ€¦",
